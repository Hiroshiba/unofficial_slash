based on Mutual Combination of Robust Principal
Component Analysis and Subharmonic Summation

Abstract—This paper presents a new method of singing voice
analysis that performs mutually-dependent singing voice separation and vocal fundamental frequency (F0) estimation. Vocal F0
estimation is considered to become easier if singing voices can be
separated from a music audio signal, and vocal F0 contours ar
e
useful for singing voice separation. This calls for an approach
that improves the performance of each of these tasks by using
the results of the other. The proposed method first performs robust principal component analysis (RPCA) for roughly extracting
singing voices from a target music audio signal. The F0 contour
of the main melody is then estimated from the separated singing
voices by finding the optimal temporal path over an F0 salienc
y
spectrogram. Finally, the singing voices are separated again more
accurately by combining a conventional time-frequency mas
k
given by RPCA with another mask that passes only the harmonic
structures of the estimated F0s. Experimental results showed that
the proposed method significantly improved the performance
s
of both singing voice separation and vocal F0 estimation. Th
e
proposed method also outperformed all the other methods of
singing voice separation submitted to an international music
analysis competition called MIREX 2014.

I. INTRODUCTION
S
INGING voice analysis is important for active music listening interfaces [1] that enable a user to customize the
contents of existing music recordings in ways not limited to
frequency equalization and tempo adjustment. Since singin
g
voices tend to form main melodies and strongly affect the
moods of musical pieces, several methods have been proposed
for editing the three major kinds of acoustic characteristics of
singing voices: fundamental frequencies (F0s), timbres, and
volumes. A system of speech analysis and synthesis called
TANDEM-STRAIGHT [2], for example, decomposes human
voices into F0s, spectral envelopes (timbres), and non-periodic
components. High-quality F0- and/or timbre-changed singing
voices can then be resynthesized by manipulating F0s and
spectral envelopes. Ohishi et al. [3] represents F0 or volume
dynamics of singing voices by using a probabilistic model an
d
transfers those dynamics to other singing voices. Note that
these methods deal only with isolated singing voices. Fujihara
and Goto [4] model the spectral envelopes of singing voices i
n
polyphonic audio signals to directly modify the vocal timbres
without affecting accompaniment parts.

To develop a system that enables a user to edit the acoustic
characteristics of singing voices included in a polyphonic audio signal, we need to accurately perform both singing voice
separation and vocal F0 estimation. The performance of each
task could be improved by using the results of the other because there is a complementary relationship between them. If
singing voices were extracted from a polyphonic audio signal,
it would be easy to estimate a vocal F0 contour from them.
Vocal F0 contours are useful for improving singing voice separation. In most studies, however, only the one-way dependency
between the two tasks has been considered. Singing voice
separation has often been used as preprocessing for vocal F0
estimation, and vice versa.
In this paper we propose a novel singing voice analysis
method that performs singing voice separation and vocal F0
estimation in an interdependent manner. The core component
of the proposed method is preliminary singing voice separation
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) [5].
Given the amplitude spectrogram (matrix) of a music signal,
RPCA decomposes it into the sum of a low-rank matrix and
a sparse matrix. Since accompaniments such as drums and
rhythm guitars tend to play similar phrases repeatedly, the
resulting spectrogram generally has a low-rank structure. Since
singing voices vary significantly and continuously over tim
e
and the power of singing voices concentrates on harmonic
partials, on the other hand, the resulting spectrogram has a not
low-rank but sparse structure. Although RPCA is considered to
be one of the most prominent ways of singing voice separation
,
non-repetitive instrument sounds are inevitably assigned to a
sparse spectrogram. To filter out such non-vocal sounds, we
estimate the F0 contour of singing voices from the sparse
spectrogram based on a saliency-based F0 estimation method
called subharmonic summation (SHS) [6] and extract only a
series of harmonic structures corresponding to the estimated
F0s. Here we propose a novel F0 saliency spectrogram in the
time-frequency domain by leveraging the results of RPCA.
This can avoid the negative effect of accompaniment sounds
in vocal F0 estimation.
Our method is similar in spirit to a recent method of singing
voice separation that combines rhythm-based and pitch-based
methods of singing voice separation [7]. It first estimates two
types of soft time-frequency masks passing only singing voices
by using a singing voice separation method called REPET-SIM
[8] and a vocal F0 estimation method (originally proposed
for multiple-F0 estimation [9]). Those soft masks are then

integrated into a unified mask in a weighted manner. On the
other hand, our method is deeply linked to human perception
of a main melody in polyphonic music [10], [11]. Fig. 1 shows
an instrumental composition of popular music. It is thought
that humans easily recognize the sounds of rhythm instruments
such as drums and rhythm guitars [10] and that in the residual
sounds of non-rhythm instruments, spectral components that
have predominant harmonic structures are identified as main
melodies [11]. The proposed method first separates the sounds
of rhythm instruments by using a time-frequency (TF) mask
estimated by RPCA. Main melodies are extracted as singing
voices from the residual sounds by using another mask that
passes only predominant harmonic structures. Although the
main melodies do not always correspond to singing voices,
we do not deal with vocal activity detection (VAD) in this
paper because many promising VAD methods [12]–[14] can
be applied as pre- or post-processing of our method.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces related works. Section III explains the proposed
method. Section IV describes the evaluation experiments and
the MIREX 2014 singing-voice-separation task results. Section
V describes the experiments determining robust parameters for
the proposed method. Section VI concludes this paper.
II. RELATED WORK
This section introduces related works on vocal F0 estimation
and singing voice separation. It also reviews some studies on
the combination of those two tasks.
A. Vocal F0 Estimation
A typical approach to vocal F0 estimation is to identify
F0s that have predominant harmonic structures by using an
F0 saliency spectrogram that represents how likely the F0
is to exist in each time-frequency bin. A core of this approach is how to estimate a saliency spectrogram [15]–[19].
Goto [15] proposed a statistical multiple-F0 analyzer called
PreFEst that approximates an observed spectrum as a superimposition of harmonic structures. Each harmonic structure
is represented as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the
mixing weights of GMMs corresponding to different F0s can
be regarded as a saliency spectrum. Rao et al. [16] tracked
multiple candidates of vocal F0s including the F0s of locally
predominant non-vocal sounds and then identified vocal F0s
by focusing on the temporal instability of vocal components.
Dressler [17] attempted to reduce the number of possible overtones by identifying which overtones are derived from a vocal
harmonic structure. Salamon et al. [19] proposed a heuristicsbased method called MELODIA that focuses on the characteristics of vocal F0 contours. The contours of F0 candidates
are obtained by using a saliency spectrogram based on subharmonic summation. This method achieved the state-of-the-art
results in vocal F0 estimation.
B. Singing Voice Separation
A typical approach to singing voice separation is to make
a TF mask that separates a target music spectrogram into a
vocal spectrogram and an accompaniment spectrogram. There
are two types of TF masks: soft masks and binary masks. An
ideal binary mask assigns 1 to a TF unit if the power of singing
voices in the unit is larger than that of the other concurrent
sounds, and 0 otherwise. Although vocal and accompaniment
sounds overlap with various ratios at many TF units, excellent
separation can be achieved using binary masking. This is related to a phenomenon called auditory masking: a louder sound
tends to mask a weaker sound within a particular frequency
band [20].
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has often been used
for separating a polyphonic spectrogram into nonnegative components and clustering those components into vocal components and accompaniment components [21]–[23]. Another approach is to exploit the temporal and spectral continuity of
accompaniment sounds and the sparsity of singing voices in
the TF domain [24]–[26]. Tachibana et al. [24], for example,
proposed harmonic/percussive source separation (HPSS) based
on the isotropic natures of harmonic and percussive sounds.
Both components were estimated jointly via maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Fitzgerald et al. [25] proposed an
HPSS method applying different median filters to polyphonic
spectra along the time and frequency directions. Jeong et al.
[26] statistically modeled the continuities of accompaniment
sounds and the sparsity of singing voices. Yen et al. [27] separated vocal, harmonic, and percussive components by clustering frequency modulation features in an unsupervised manner.
Huang et al. [28] have recently used a deep recurrent neural
network for supervised singing voice separation.
Some state-of-the-art methods of singing voice separation
focus on the repeating characteristics of accompaniment sounds
[5], [8], [29]. Accompaniment sounds are often played by
musical instruments that repeat similar phrases throughout the
music, such as drums and rhythm guitars. To identify repetitive patterns in a polyphonic audio signal, Rafii et al. [29]
took the median of repeated spectral segments detected by an
autocorrelation method, and improved the separation by using
a similarity matrix [8]. Huang et al. [5] used RPCA to identify
repetitive structures of accompaniment sounds. Liutkus et al.
[30] proposed kernel additive modeling that combines many
conventional methods and accounts for various features like
continuity, smoothness, and stability over time or frequency.
These methods tend to work robustly in several situations or
genres because they make few assumptions about the target
signal. Driedger et al. [31] proposed a cascading method that
first decomposes a music spectrogram into harmonic, percussive, and residual spectrograms, each of which is further decomposed into partial components of singing voices and those
3
of accompaniment sounds by using conventional methods [28],
[32]. Finally, the estimated components are reassembled to
form singing voices and accompaniment sounds.
C. One-way or Mutual Combination
Since singing voice separation and vocal F0 estimation have
complementary relationships, the performance of each task can
be improved by using the results of the other. Some vocal F0
estimation methods use singing voice separation techniques as
preprocessing for reducing the negative effect of accompaniment sounds in polyphonic music [24], [29], [33], [34]. This
approach results in comparatively better performance when the
volume of singing voices is relatively low [35]. Some methods
of singing voice separation use vocal F0 estimation techniques
because the energy of a singing voice is concentrated on an F0
and its harmonic partials [32], [36], [37]. Virtanen et al. [32]
proposed a method that first separates harmonic components
using a predominant F0 contour. The residual components
are then modeled by NMF and accompaniment sounds are
extracted. Singing voices and accompaniment sounds are separated by using the learned parameters again.
Some methods perform both vocal F0 estimation and singing
voice separation. Hsu et al. [38] proposed a tandem algorithm that iterates these two tasks. Durrieu et al. [39] used
source-filter NMF for directly modeling the F0s and timbres
of singing voices and accompaniment sounds. Rafii et al. [7]
proposed a framework that combines repetition-based source
separation with F0-based source separation. A unified TF mask
for singing voice separation is obtained by combining the
TF masks estimated by the two types of source separation
in a weighted manner. Caba˜nas-Molero et al. [40] proposed
a method that roughly separates singing voices from stereo
recordings by focusing on the spatial diversity (called center extraction) and then estimates a vocal F0 contour for the
separated voices. The separation of singing voices is further
improved by using the F0 contour.
III. PROPOSED METHOD
The proposed method jointly executes singing voice separation and vocal F0 estimation (Fig. 2). Our method uses robust principal component analysis (RPCA) to estimate a mask
(called an RPCA mask) that separates a target music spectrogram into low-rank components and sparse components. The
vocal F0 contour is then estimated from the separated sparse
components via Viterbi search on an F0 saliency spectrogram,
resulting in another mask (called a harmonic mask) that separates harmonic components of the estimated F0 contour. These
masks are integrated via element-wise multiplication, and finally singing voices and accompaniment sounds are obtained
by separating the music spectrogram according to the integrated mask. The proposed method can work well for complicated music audio signals. Even if the volume of singing
voices is relatively low and music audio signals contain various
kinds of musical instruments, the harmonic structures (F0s) of
singing voices can be discovered by calculating an F0 saliency
spectrogram from an RPCA mask.

Fig. 2. Overview of the proposed method. First an RPCA mask that separates
low-rank components in a polyphonic spectrogram is computed. From this
mask and the original spectrogram, a vocal F0 contour is estimated. The RPCA
mask and the harmonic mask calculated from the F0 contour are combined by
multiplication, and finally the singing voice and the accompaniment sounds
are separated using the integrated mask.
A. Singing Voice Separation
Vocal and accompaniment sounds are separated by combining TF masks based on RPCA and vocal F0s.
1) Calculating an RPCA Mask: A singing voice separation
method based on RPCA [5] assumes that accompaniment and
vocal components tend to have low-rank and sparse structures,
respectively, in the TF domain. Since spectra of harmonic
instruments (e.g., pianos and guitars) are consistent for each
F0 and the F0s are basically discretized at a semitone level,
harmonic spectra having the same shape appear repeatedly in
the same musical piece. Spectra of non-harmonic instruments
(e.g., drums) also tend to appear repeatedly. Vocal spectra, in
contrast, rarely have the same shape because the vocal timbres
and F0s vary continuously and significantly over time.
RPCA decomposes an input matrix X into the sum of a
low-rank matrix XL and a sparse matrix XS by solving the
following convex optimization problem:
minimize kXLk∗ + λˆkXSk1 (subject to XL + XS = X),
λˆ =
λ
p
max(T, F)
, (1)
where X, XL, and XS ∈ R
T ×F , k·k∗ and k·k1 represent the
nuclear norm (also known as the trace norm) and the L1-norm,
respectively. λ is a positive parameter that controls the balance
between the low-rankness of XL and the sparsity of XS. To
find optimal XL and XS, we use an efficient inexact version
4
of the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithm [41].
When X is the amplitude spectrogram given by the shorttime Fourier transform (STFT) of a target music audio signal
(T is the number of frames and F is the number of frequency
bins), the spectral components having repetitive structures are
assigned to XL and the other varying components are assigned
to XS. Let t and f be a time frame and a frequency bin,
respectively (1 ≤ t ≤ T and 1 ≤ f ≤ F). We obtain a TF
soft mask M(s)
RPCA ∈ R
T ×F by using Wiener filtering:
M
(s)
RPCA(t, f) = |XS(t, f)|
|XS(t, f)| + |XL(t, f)|
. (2)
A TF binary mask M(b)
RPCA ∈ R
T ×F is also obtained by comparing XL with XS in an element-wise manner as follows:
M
(b)
RPCA(t, f) = 
1 if |XS(t, f)| > γ|XL(t, f)|
0 otherwise . (3)
The gain γ adjusts the energy between the low-rank and sparse
matrices. In this paper the gain parameter is set to 1.0, which
was reported to achieve good separation performance [5]. Note
that M(b)
RPCA is used only for estimating a vocal F0 contour in
Section III-B.
Using M(s)
RPCA or M(b)
RPCA, the vocal spectrogram X
(∗)
VOCAL ∈
R
T ×F is roughly estimated as follows:
X
(∗)
VOCAL = M(∗)
RPCA ⊙ X, (4)
where ⊙ indicates the element-wise product. If the value of
λ for singing voice separation is different from that for F0
estimation, we execute two versions of RPCA with different
values of λ (Fig. 2). If we were to use the same value of λ
for both processes, RPCA would be executed only once. In
section V we discuss the optimal values of λ in detail.
2) Calculating a Harmonic Mask: Using a vocal F0 contour Yˆ = {yˆ1, yˆ2, · · · , yˆT } (see details in Section III-B), we
make a harmonic mask MH ∈ R
T ×F . Assuming that the
energy of vocal spectra is localized on the harmonic partials
of vocal F0s, we defined MH ∈ R
T ×F as:
MH(t, f) =


u = f(nhyˆt +

W = w

(5)
where w(n; W) denotes the n-th value of a window function
of length W, f(h) denotes the index of the nearest time frame
corresponding to a frequency h [Hz], n is the index of a
harmonic partial, w is a frequency width [Hz] for extracting
the energy around the partial, hyˆt
is the estimated vocal F0
[Hz] of frame t. We chose the Tukey window whose a shape
parameter is set to 0.5 as a window function.
3) Integrating the Two Masks for Singing Voice Separation:
Given the RPCA mask (soft) M(s)
RPCA and the harmonic mask
MH, we define an integrated soft mask M(s)
RPCA+H as follows:
M(s)
RPCA+H = M(s)
RPCA ⊙ MH. (6)

Fig. 3. An F0-saliency spectrogram is obtained by integrating an SHS spectrogram derived from a separated vocal spectrogram with an F0 enhancement
spectrogram derived from an RPCA mask.
Furthermore, an integrated binary mask M(b)
RPCA+H is also defined
as:
M(b)
RPCA+H(t, f) = 
1 if M(s)
RPCA+H(t, f) > 0.5
0 otherwise.
. (7)
Although the integrated masks have fewer spectral units assigned to singing voices than the RPCA mask and the harmonic mask do, they provide better separation quality (see
the comparative results reported in Section V).
Using the integrated masks M(∗)
RPCA+H, the vocal and accompaniment spectrograms Xˆ

VOCAL and Xˆ
(∗)
ACCOM are given by
Xˆ
(∗)
VOCAL = M(∗)
RPCA+H ⊙ X,
Xˆ
(∗)
ACCOM = X − Xˆ
(∗)
VOCAL. (8)
Finally, time signals (waveforms) of singing voices and accompaniment sounds are resynthesized by computing the inverse
STFT with the phases of the original music spectrogram.
B. Vocal F0 Estimation
We propose a new method that estimates a vocal F0 contour
Yˆ = {yˆ1, · · · , yˆT } from the vocal spectrogram X
(b)
VOCAL by using the binary mask M(b)
RPCA. A robust F0-saliency spectrogram
is obtained by using both X
(b)
VOCAL and M(b)
RPCA and a vocal F0
contour is estimated by finding an optimal path in the saliency
spectrogram with the Viterbi search algorithm.
1) Calculating a Log-frequency Spectrogram: We convert
the vocal spectrogram X
(b)
VOCAL ∈ R
T ×F to the log-frequency
spectrogram X′
VOCAL ∈ R
T ×C by using spline interpolation on
the dB scale. A frequency hf [Hz] is translated to the index
of a log-frequency bin c (1
5
where hlow is a predefined lowest frequency [Hz] and p a
frequency resolution [cents] per bin. The frequency hlow must
be sufficiently low to include the low end of a singing voice
spectrum (i.e., 30 Hz).
To take into account the non-linearity of human auditory
perception, we multiply the A-weighting function RA(f) to
the vocal spectrogram X
(b)
VOCAL in advance. RA(f) is given by
RA(f) =
122002h

. (10)
This function is a rough approximation of the inverse of the
40-phon equal-loudness curve1
and is used for amplifying the
frequency bands that we are perceptually sensitive to, and
attenuating the frequency bands that we are less sensitive to
[19].
2) Calculating an F0-Saliency Spectrogram: Fig. 3 shows
the procedure of calculating an F0-Saliency spectrogram. We
calculate a subharmonic summation (SHS) spectrogram SSHS ∈
R
T ×C from the tentative vocal spectrogram X′
VOCAL ∈ R
T ×C
in the log-frequency domain. SHS [6] is the most basic and
light-weight algorithm that underlies many vocal F0 estimation
methods [19], [42]. SSHS is given by
SSHS(t, c) = X
N
n=1
βnX′
VOCAL 
t, c +

1200 log2 n
p
 , (11)
where c is the index of a log-frequency bin (1 ≤ c ≤ C), N is
the number of harmonic partials considered, and βn is a decay
factor (0.86n−1
in this paper).
We then calculate an F0 enhancement spectrogram SRPCA ∈
R
T ×C from the RPCA mask MRPCA. To improve the performance of vocal F0 estimation, we propose to focus on the
regularity (periodicity) of harmonic partials over the linear
frequency axis. The RPCA binary mask MRPCA can be used
for reducing half or double pitch errors because the harmonic
structure of the singing voice strongly appears in it.
We first take the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of each
time frame of the binary mask as follows:
F(t, k) =






F
X−1
f=0
M
(b)
RPCA(t, f)e
−i
2πkf
F






. (12)
This idea is similar to the cepstral analysis that extracts the
periodicity of harmonic partials from log-power spectra. We do
not need to compute the log of the RPCA binary mask because
MRPCA ∈ {0, 1}
T ×F . The F0 enhancement spectrogram SRPCA
is obtained by picking the value corresponding to a frequency
index c:
SRPCA(t, c) = F

where hc is the frequency [Hz] corresponding to log-frequency
bin c and htop is the highest frequency [Hz] considered (Nyquist
frequency).

Finally, the reliable F0-saliency spectrogram S ∈ R
T ×C is
given by integrating SSHS and SRPCA as follows:
S(t, c) = SSHS(t, c)SRPCA(t, c)
α
, (14)
where α is a weighting factor for adjusting the balance between SSHS and SRPCA. When α is 0, SRPCA is ignored, resulting
in the standard SHS method. While each bin of SSHS reflects
the total volume of harmonic partials, each bin of SRPCA reflects
the number of harmonic partials.
3) Executing Viterbi Search: Given the F0-saliency spectrogram S, we estimate the optimal F0 contour Yˆ = {yˆ1, · · · , yˆT }
by solving the following problem:
Yˆ = argmax
y1,...,yT

t=1 (

,
(15)
where cl and ch are the lowest and highest log-frequency bins
of an F0 search range. G(yt, yt+1) is the transition cost function from the current F0 yt to the next F0 yt+1. G(yt, yt+1)
is defined as
G(yt, yt+1) = 1

. (16)
where b =

and cy indicates the log-frequency [cents]
corresponding to log-frequency bin c. This function is equivalent to the Laplace distribution whose standard deviation is
150 [cents]. Note that the shifting interval of time frames is
10 [ms]. This optimization problem can be efficiently solved
using the Viterbi search algorithm.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
This section reports experiments conducted for evaluating
singing voice separation and vocal F0 estimation. The results
of the Singing Voice Separation task of MIREX 2014, which
is a world-wide competition between algorithms for music
analysis, are also shown.
A. Singing Voice Separation
Singing voice separation using different binary masks was
evaluated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
1) Datasets and Parameters: The MIR-1K dataset2
(MIR1K) and the MedleyDB dataset (MedleyDB) [43] were used
for evaluating singing voice separation. Note that we used
the 110 “Undivided” song clips of MIR-1K and the 45 clips
of MedleyDB listed in Table II. The clips in MIR-1K were
recorded at a 16 kHz sampling rate with 16 bit resolution and
the clips in MedleyDB were recorded at a 44.1 kHz sampling
rate with 16 bit resolution. For each clip in both datasets,
singing voices and accompaniment sounds were mixed at three
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) conditions: −5, 0, and 5 dB.
The datasets and the parameters used for evaluation are
summarized in Table I, where the parameters for computing
the STFT (window size and hopsize), SHS (the number N of
harmonic partials), RPCA (a sparsity factor λ), a harmonic
mask (frequency width w), and a saliency spectrogram (a
weighting factor α) are listed. We empirically determined the
parameters w and λ according to the results of grid search (see
details in Section V). The same value of λ (0.8) was used for
both RPCA computations in Fig.2. The frequency range for
the vocal F0 search was restricted to 80–720 Hz.
2) Compared Methods: The following binary masks were
compared.
RPCA: Using only an RPCA soft mask M(s)
RPCA
H: Using only a harmonic mask MH
RPCA-H-S: Using an integrated soft mask M(s)
RPCA+H
RPCA-H-B: Using an integrated binary mask M(b)
RPCA+H
RPCA-H-GT: Using an integrated soft mask made by using
a ground-truth F0 contour
ISM: Using an ideal soft mask
“RPCA” is a conventional RPCA-based method [5]. “H”
used only a harmonic mask created from an estimated F0 contour. “RPCA-H-S” and “RPCA-H-B” represent the proposed
methods using soft masks and binary masks, respectively, and
“RPCA-H-GT” means a condition that the ground-truth vocal
F0s were given (the upper bound of separation quality for the
proposed framework). “ISM” represents a condition that oracle
TF masks were estimated such that the ground-truth vocal and
2https://sites.google.com/site/unvoicedsoundseparation/mir-1k
accompaniment spectrograms were obtained (the upper bound
of separation quality of TF masking methods). For H, RPCAH-S and RPCA-H-B, the accuracies of vocal F0 estimation are
described in Section IV-B.
3) Evaluation Measures: The BSS EVAL toolbox3
[44] was
used for measuring the separation performance. The principle
of BSS EVAL is to decompose an estimate sˆ of a true source
signal s as follows:
sˆ(t) = starget(t) + einterf(t) + enoise(t) + eartif(t), (17)
where starget is an allowed distortion of the target source s and
einterf, enoise and eartif are respectively the interference of the
unwanted sources, perturbing noise, and artifacts in the separated signals (such as musical noise). Since we assume that
an original signal consists of only vocal and accompaniment
sounds, the perturbing noise enoise was ignored. Given the
decomposition, three performance measures are defined: the
Source-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), the Source-to-Interference
Ratio (SIR) and the Source-to-Artifacts Ratio (SAR):
SDR(ˆs, s) := 10 log10 
kstargetk
2
keinterf + eartifk
2

, (18)
SIR(ˆs, s) := 10 log10 
kstargetk
2
keinterfk
2

, (19)
SAR(ˆs, s) := 10 log10 
kstarget + einterfk
2
keartifk
2

, (20)
where k · k denotes a Euclidean norm. We then calculated the
Normalized SDR (NSDR) that measures the improvement of
the SDR between the estimate sˆ of a target source signal s and
the original mixture x. To measure the overall separation performance we calculated the Global NSDR (GNSDR), which
is a weighted mean of the NSDRs over all the mixtures xk
(weighted by their length lk):
NSDR(ˆs, s, x) = SDR(ˆs, s) − SDR(x, s), (21)
GNSDR =
P
k
lkNSDR(ˆsk, sk, xk)
P
k
lk
. (22)
In the same way, the Global SIR (GSIR) and the Global SAR
(GSAR) were calculated from the SIRs and the SARs. For all
these ratios, higher values represent better separation quality.
Since this paper does not deal with the VAD and we intended to examine the effect of the harmonic mask for vocal
separation, we used only the voiced sections for evaluation;
that is to say, the amplitude of the signals in unvoiced sections
was set to 0 when calculating the evaluation scores.

Fig. 5. An example of singing voice separation by the proposed method. The results of “Coldwar / LizNelson” in MedleyDB mixed at a −5 dB SNR are shown.
From left to right, an original singing voice, an original accompaniment sound, a mixed sound, a separated singing voice, and a separated accompaniment
sound are shown. The upper figures are spectrograms obtained by taking the STFT and the lower figures are resynthesized time signals.
4) Experimental Results: Fig. 4 shows the evaluation results. In spite of F0 estimation errors, the proposed methods
using soft masks (RPCA-H-S) and those using binary masks
(RPCA-H-B) outperformed both RPCA and H in GNSDR for
all datasets. This indicates that combining an RPCA mask and
a harmonic mask is effective for improving the separation
quality of singing voices and accompaniment sounds. The
removal of the spectra of non-repeating instruments (e.g., bass
guitar) significantly improved the separation quality. RPCAH-S outperformed RPCA-H-B in GNSDR, GSAR, and GSIR
of the singing voice. On the other hand, RPCA-H-B outperformed RPCA-H-S in GSIR of the accompaniment and H
outperformed both RPCA-H-B and RPCA-H-S. This indicates
that a harmonic mask is useful for singing voice suppression.
Fig. 5 shows an example of an output of singing voice
separation by the proposed method. We can see that vocal
and accompaniment sounds were sufficiently separated from
a mixed signal even though the volume level of vocal sounds
was lower than that of accompaniment sounds.
B. Vocal F0 Estimation
We compared the vocal F0 estimation of the proposed method
with conventional methods.

clips of popular music which were recorded at a 44.1 kHz
sampling rate with 16 bit resolution. The dataset contains 20
songs with English lyrics performed in the style of American
popular music in the 1980s and 80 songs with Japanese lyrics
performed in the style of Japanese popular music in the 1990s.
2) Compared Methods: The following four methods were
compared.
PreFEst-V: PreFEst (saliency spectrogram) + Viterbi search
MELODIA-V: MELODIA (saliency spectrogram) + Viterbi
search
MELODIA: The original MELODIA algorithm
Proposed: F0-saliency spectrogram + Viterbi (proposed
method)
PreFEst [15] is a statistical multi-F0 analyzer that is still
considered to be competitive for vocal F0 estimation. Although
PreFEst contains three processes —the PreFEst-front-end for
frequency analysis, the PreFEst-core computing a saliency
spectrogram, and the PreFEst-back-end that tracks F0 contours using multiple agents —we used only the PreFEst-core
and estimated F0 contours by using the Viterbi search described in Section III-B3 (“PreFEst-V”). MELODIA is a stateof-the-art algorithm for vocal F0 estimation that focuses on the
characteristics of vocal F0 contours. We applied the Viterbi
search to a saliency spectrogram derived from MELODIA
(“MELODIA-V”) and also tested the original MELODIA algorithm (“MELODIA”). In this experiment we used the MELODIA implementation provided as a vamp plug-in4
.
Singing voice separation based on RPCA [5] was applied
before computing conventional methods as preprocessing (“w/
RPCA” in Table III). We investigated the effectiveness of the
proposed method in conjunction with preprocessing of singing
voice separation.
3) Evaluation Measures: We measured the raw pitch accuracy (RPA) defined as the ratio of the number of frames in
which correct vocal F0s were detected to the total number of
voiced frames. An estimated value was considered correct if
the difference between it and the ground-truth F0 was 50 cents
(half a semitone) or less.
4) Experimental Results: Table III shows the experimental
results of vocal F0 estimation, where each value is an average
accuracy over all clips. The results show that the proposed
method achieved the best performance in terms of average

accuracy. With MedleyDB and RWC-MDB-P-2001 the proposed method significantly outperformed the other methods,
while the performance of MELODIA-V and MELODIA were
better than that of the proposed method with MIR-1K. This
might be due to the different instrumentation of songs included
in each dataset. Most clips in MedleyDB and RWC-MDB-P2001 contain the sounds of many kinds of musical instruments,
whereas most clips in MIR-1K contain the sounds of only a
small number of musical instruments.
These results are originated from the characteristics of the
proposed method. In vocal F0 estimation, the spectral periodicity of an RPCA binary mask is used to enhance vocal spectra.
The harmonic structures of singing voices appear clearly in the
RPCA mask when music audio signals contain various kinds
of repetitive musical instrument sounds. The proposed method
therefore works well especially for songs of particular genres
such as rock and pops.
C. MIREX2014
We submitted our algorithm to the Singing Voice Separation
task of the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange
(MIREX) 2014, which is a community-based framework for
the formal evaluation of analysis algorithms. Since the datasets
are not freely distributed to the participants, MIREX provides
meaningful and fair scientific evaluations.
There is some difference between our submission for MIREX
and the algorithm described in this paper. The major difference
is that only an SHS spectrogram (with the exception of an
F0 enhancement spectrogram in Section III-B2) was used as a
saliency spectrogram in the submission. Instead a simple vocal
activity detection (VAD) method based on an energy threshold
was used after singing voice separation.
1) Dataset: 100 monaural clips of pop music recorded at
44.1-kHz sampling rate with 16-bit resolution were used for
evaluation. The duration of each clip was 30 seconds.
2) Compared Methods: 11 submissions participated in the
task5

for all song clips, respectively.
gorithms using deep recurrent neural networks [28]. YC1 separates singing voices by clustering modulation features [27].
RP1 is the REPET-SIM algorithm that identifies repetitive
structures in polyphonic music by using a similarity matrix [8].
GW1 uses Bayesian NMF to model a polyphonic spectrogram,
and clusters the learned bases based on acoustic features [23].
JL1 uses the temporal and spectral discontinuity of singing
voices [26], and LFR1 uses light kernel additive modeling
based on the algorithm in [30]. RNA1 first estimates predominant F0s and then reconstructs an isolated vocal signal based
on harmonic sinusoidal modeling using estimated F0s. IIY1
and IIY2 are our submissions. The only difference between
IIY1 and IIY2 is their parameters. The parameters for both
submissions are listed in Table IV.
3) Evaluation Results: Fig. 6 shows the evaluation results
for all submissions. Our submissions (IIY1 and IIY2) provided the best mean NSDR for both vocal and accompaniment sounds. Even though the submissions using the proposed
method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in MIREX
2014, there is still room for improving their performances. As
described in Section V-A, the robust range for the parameter
w is from 40 to 60. We set the parameter to 100 in the submissions, however, and that must have considerably reduced
the sound quality of both separated vocal and accompaniment
sounds.
V. PARAMETER TUNING
In this section we discuss the effects of parameters that
determine the performances of singing voice separation and
vocal F0 estimation.
A. Singing Voice Separation
The parameters λ and w affect the quality of singing voice
separation. λ is the sparsity factor of RPCA described in Section III-A1 and w is the frequency width of the harmonic mask
described in Section III-A2. The parameter λ can be used
to trade off the rank of a low-rank matrix with the sparsity
of a sparse matrix. The sparse matrix is sparser when λ is
larger and is less sparse when λ is smaller. When w is smaller,
fewer spectral bins around an F0 and its harmonic partials are
assigned as singing voices. This is the recall-precision tradeoff of singing voice separation. To examine the relationship
between λ and w, we evaluated the performance of singing
voice separation for combinations of λ from 0.6 to 1.2 in
steps of 0.1 and w from 20 to 90 in steps of 10.
1) Experimental Conditions: MIR-1K was used for evaluation at three mixing conditions with SNRs of −5, 0, and 5
dB. In this experiment, a harmonic mask was created using a
ground-truth F0 contour to examine only the effects of λ and
w. GNSDRs were calculated for each parameter combination.
2) Experimental Results: Fig. 7 shows the overall performance for all parameter combinations. Each unit on a grid
represents the GNSDR value. It was shown that λ from 0.6
to 1.0 and w from 40 to 60 provided robust performance in
all mixing conditions. In the −5 dB mixing condition, an
integrated mask performed better for both of the singing voice
and the accompaniment when w was smaller. This was because
most singing voice spectra were covered by accompaniment
spectra and only few singing voice spectra were dominant
around an F0 and harmonic

Fig. 7. Experimental results of grid search for singing voice separation.
GNSDR for MIR-1K is shown in each unit. From top to bottom, the results
of −5, 0, and 5 dB SNR conditions are shown. The left figures show results
for the singing voice and the right figures for the music accompaniment. In
all parts of this figure, lighter values represent better results.
B. Vocal F0 Estimation
The parameters λ and α affect the accuracy of vocal F0
estimation. λ is the sparsity factor of RPCA and α is the
weight parameter for computing the F0-saliency spectrogram
described in Section III-B2. α determines the balance between
an SHS spectrogram and an F0 enhancement spectrogram in a
F0-saliency spectrogram, and there must be range of its value
that provides robust performance. We evaluated the accuracy
of singing voice separation for combinations of λ from 0.6 to
1.1 in steps of 0.1 and α from 0 to 2.0 in steps of 0.2. RWCMDB-P-2001 was used for evaluation, and RPA was measured
for each parameter combination.
Fig. 8 shows the overall performance for all parameter combinations of grid search. Each unit on a grid represents RPA
for each parameter combination. It was shown that λ from 0.7
to 0.9 and α from 0.6 to 0.8 provided comparatively better
performance than any other parameter combinations. RPCA
with λ within the range separates vocal sounds to a moderate
degree for vocal F0 estimation. The value of α was also crucial
to estimation accuracy. The combinations with α = 0.0 yielded
especially low RPAs. This indicates that an F0 enhancement
spectrogram was effective for vocal F0 estimation.

VI. CONCLUSION
This paper described a method that performs singing voice
separation and vocal F0 estimation in a mutually-dependent
manner. The experimental results showed that the proposed
method achieves better singing voice separation and vocal F0
estimation than conventional methods do. The singing voice
separation of the proposed method was also better than that of
several state-of-the-art methods in MIREX 2014, which is an
international competition in music analysis. In the experiments
on vocal F0 estimation, the proposed method outperformed
two conventional methods that are considered to achieve the
state-of-the-art performance. Some parameters of the proposed
method significantly affect the performances of singing voice
separation and vocal F0 estimation, and we found that a particular range of those parameters results in relatively good
performance in various situations.
We plan to integrate singing voice separation and vocal F0
estimation in a unified framework. Since the proposed method
performs these tasks in a cascading manner, separation and
estimation errors are accumulated. One promising way to solve
this problem is to formulate a unified likelihood function to
be maximized by interpreting the proposed method from a
viewpoint of probabilistic modeling. To discriminate singing
voices from musical instrument sounds that have sparse and
non-repetitive structures in the TF domain like singing voices,
we attempt to focus on both the structural and timbral characteristics of singing voices as in [35]. It is also important to
conduct subjective evaluation to investigate the relationships
between the conventional measures (SDR, SIR, and SAR) and
the perceptual quality.
